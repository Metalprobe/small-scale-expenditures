# small-scale-expenditures

This project contains code used in my bachelor thesis.
Main data source is Pomocný analytický přehled, part X. (PAP X.).
This code was changed a milion times and probably does not work very well.

It might be used as an inspiration for others using similar data sources as I did.
It might be used to check the overall approach I used in the thesis.
It might not be suitable for an immediate usage on the same datasets.

I plan to update the code, make it more user friendly and remove the errors that occurred while renaming variables and columns, and while I tried to improve the code a bit.
